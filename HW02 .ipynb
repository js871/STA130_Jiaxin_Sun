    "#Summary of the Code\n",
    "#The code simulates the Monty Hall game by running it multiple times and counting how many times you win by switching doors.\n",

    "#remaining_doors = [door for door in all_doors if door != initial_choice and door != winning_door]\n",
    "#This is clearer and easier to modify if needed. For instance, if you wanted to simulate a game with more than three doors, this approach scales better.\n",
    "\n",

    "#Better Structure for Expanding:\n",

    "#Clear, simple comments explain each step, making the logic more understandable to someone reading the code for the first time.\n",

    "#Setup:\n",
    "#all_doors = [1, 2, 3]: Defines the doors.\n",
    "#initial_choice = 1: Always starts with choosing door 1 (arbitrary, can be randomized if needed).\n",
    "#win_count: Counts how many times the player wins when switching doors.\n",

    "#For Loop:\n",
    "#for _ in range(reps): The underscore (_) is used here since the loop variable isn’t needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Host Reveals a Goat:\n",
    "#The host reveals a goat by selecting from doors that aren’t the player’s choice or the winning door. The list comprehension is a concise way to handle this:\n",
    "#remaining_doors = [door for door in all_doors if door != initial_choice and door != winning_door]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Switching Doors:\n",

    "\n",
    "#Win Condition:\n",

    "# nested_dict: This is a factory function for creating deeply nested defaultdict objects, which are used to manage hierarchical structures in your data.\n",

    "# Code Explanation:\n",
    "# Initialization:\n",

    "# The Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "# The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after Monty Hall, the host of the game show Let's Make a Deal. Here’s a simplified version of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup: You’re on a game show, and there are three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize you want), and behind the other two doors are goats (which you don’t want).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choice: You pick one door.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monty’s Action: Monty Hall, who knows what’s behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, always revealing a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decision: You are then given the option to either stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question: What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car? Should you stick with your original choice or switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution:\n",
    "# Initial Choice: When you first pick a door, there’s a 1/3 chance the car is behind that door and a 2/3 chance it’s behind one of the other two doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# After Monty Opens a Door: Monty always reveals a goat. If you initially picked a goat (2/3 chance), switching will get you the car. If you initially picked the car (1/3 chance), switching will make you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimal Strategy: Switch doors. If you switch, your probability of winning the car is 2/3, whereas if you stick with your initial choice, it’s only 1/3.\n",

    "# Markovian ChatBot\n",

    "# word_used2C: A dictionary where each key is a character, and its value is another dictionary tracking word pairs and their frequencies.\n",

    "# Limited Context Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ChatBots might not fully grasp the broader context of your project, leading to less accurate or relevant suggestions.\n",
