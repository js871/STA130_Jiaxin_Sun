    "**Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do the people who have a higher frequency of hugging others will have higher self-rated mental health?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mental health level: \"WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hug frequency: \"CONNECTION_activities_hug_p3m\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health indicates how participants thought about their mental health at present.\n",
    "Using numbers from 1 to 7 to evaluate their mental health level. Higher values indicate higher levels of mental health.\n",
    "For example: 7 - A very happy person,1 - Not a happy person.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONNECTION_activities_hug_p3m indicates how often the participant hugged someone in the PAST THREE months.\n",
    "The categories of hug frequency are Daily or almost daily, A few times a month, Not in the past three months, Weekly, A few times a week, Less than monthly, and Monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health\" Using (a)histogram and (b)box plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Histograms show whether the distribution is normal, skewed, or bimodal. It can indicate different mental health trends across the population.\n",
    "(b)Because the mental health level is a continuous numerical variable, and box plot is suitable for continuous data. Box plots give a simpler summary of data spread by showing the quartiles. I will get the Minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Median), third quartile (Q3), and maximum (Maximum) by using a box plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"CONNECTION_activities_hug_p3m\" using bar plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the hug frequency is separated and is not continuous. A bar plot is suitable for categorical data. It is good at comparing the differences between different categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question, I assume that there is a linear relationship between hug frequency and mental health. And I will use simple linear regression analysis. The hug frequency will be the independent and mental health score will be the dependent variable.\n",
    "Also, I assume this is normally distributed. Each data point is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Participants with a higher frequency of hugs will have higher levels of mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: If the Hypothesis is true, I will expect to see a positive coefficient, which proves participants with a higher frequency of hugs will have higher levels of mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: This analysis is important for the research of finding the relationship between physical interaction and mental health level. If the P value is higher than 0.05, then there is no significant relationship, so we could consider about focus on other factors that may be more important for mental health, rather than physical interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticityï¼šI assume that the variance of the residuals remains constant at every level of the independent variables.\n"
